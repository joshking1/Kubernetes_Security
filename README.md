# Kubernetes_Security

DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. 

It's an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle.

What is DevSecOps vs DevOps?

DevOps is the process of integrating development and operations, while DevSecOps is a subset of that which focuses on security.

The two concepts are not mutually exclusive, but they do have different goals.
